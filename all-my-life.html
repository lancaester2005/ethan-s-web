Today I got back home from my dentist's appointment Camden was at ballroom. When he got home the fun began. When got back it was at first normal mom asked him if he got his homework done before he left to ballroom(he come home then he goes to ballroom). I don't know if he did his homework or not but that doesn't matter. Later after dinner, my mom had us pick us the basement. When we were done I when and told her that. I knew that we did something wrong because when we do any work we do something wrong. Then she came downstairs, and said “did you vacuum at all there is stuff all over the floor”-little tiny stuff-“and you didn't get under the table”. She was yelling the entire time. Then she had us doing it the “right way”. She yelled at Camden the most because he wasn't going fast enough. She also when I was trying to help Camden she said to just him do it then she had me do something else. She yelled at Camden for everything. Before dinner, we had to do the upstairs. Then after we were done with the basement mom had us watch her kid because her brother called and wanted to talk to her. While she was on the phone I heard her crying. After that, I tried to listen more but Camden was being too loud with Brigham so I couldn't hear. Then I went downstairs to just lay down I had just worked for like 2h strait so I was tired. Then when I came back   Camden and mom were talking about therapy. Camden said, “Ethan heard you talking about it so we tolled dad and he said that he needs to syn a paper”. My mom said, “well which is more important your teeth or your mind”. Camden said, “Your mind is more important so you have to get dad OK it”. Mom was not happy about that. She said “even if he doesn't sign the paper I am taking you anyways...I not talking about this right now ”. Then mitch came home and we said prar. then after prayer I Had to put the kid down to bed, but Camden said and heard what he said. “I’m not going to therapy” Then mitch said “it’s beneficial”. Just a side note how does he how. Then my mom said, “Fine go to bed”.
