<p>Just a brief overview of today June 27, 2018, she yelled at us in the morning she has a loud Voice.
<br><br>
OK, today July 5, 2018, me and Camden were playing with each other nicely ,this is very rare, and she just yelled at us. I forgot to say something buy last night (5) Brigham wanted me and not Mitch him called my dad once or twice by said that or something like that Mitches scared and ran up the stars with the baby crying. <br>
<br>
July 11 mom said that maybe we can buy movies on our kindles which has dad’s Amazon account on. Mom sometimes threatens dad like if you don't answer then I get my way whatever her way is in the situation. And every time they have an argument at the car she always says don't make me get Mitch or something like that they don't fight by my dad's car a lot. Mom also took a day away not giving a day back in return dad did say yes to give her a day but the reason is that he didn't what to fight her for in 
<br><br>
Today is August 21, 2018,<br>
<br> So yesterday the first day of school my mom asked where does your dad work which school does he was I thought was that well she can just email him and ask him herself. Then I thought for more money, but she said “so we can switch to Wednesday” that is something done in an email on to have your kids ask your parents here. <br>

Today so far my mom has yelled a lot but we have been working from 1030 Am to 4 in the afternoon we cleaned the garage, bathrooms, took all the dead plants to the middle of the mountains, and the truck (is a ford explorer so a car ) so. Guess how much we got paid zero. Now my mom wants to be all Goody goody and she puts on a very good mask (if you know what I mean). The only people she can’t fool is me (Ethan), dad(not Mitch), and all the Lancaster family, but sadly Camden’s on the Fence so we are trying to show him that she is evil he is starting to get Finally. She also said that “ you only do this every other weekend and all the others you go to your dads and play video games” so that made me very mad because that not all we do. She also is trying to force me to take band next year but I don't want to, so I just wanted to say that so now I am finally done. Then we had to more work at like 430 to 5. Then we when out to eat fun right no not them Mitch is having really bad back pain (yes) and all the way home he is yell at Camden for being annoying and for saying die 2 times but Mitch was saying shut up like 50 times all the way home. Then mom said that he was saying shut up he still didn't care he was still saying shut up it is about 630 pm right now and he is still mad. Mitch yelling at me more.<br>

This is a long story so let me start from the beginning. So I was playing the piano or practicing and I heard my mom and Camden fighting about video games(my mom claim is not a fight or debate even though it was). So I stopped playing and just listen. Then I was out to talk. I said so how the debate going

Today I got back home from my dentist appointment Camden was at ballroom. When he got home the fun began.When got back it was at first normal mom asked him if got his homework done before he left to ballroom(he come home then he goes to ballroom). I don't know if he did his homework or not but that doesn't matter. Later after dinner my mom had us pick us the basement. When we were done I when and told her that we were done. I knew that we did something wrong, because when we do any work we do something wrong. Then she came down stairs,and said “did you vacuum at all there is stuff all over the floor!”-little tiny stuff-“and you didn't get under the table”! She was yelling the entire time. Then she had us doing it the “right way”. She yelled at Camden the most because he wasn't going fast enough. She also when I was trying to help Camden she said to just him do it then she had me do something else. She yelled at Camden for everything. Before dinner we had to do the up stairs. Then after we were done with basement mom had us watch her kid because her brother called and wanted to talk to her. While she was on the phone I heard her crying. After that I tried to listen more but Camden was being too loud with Brigham so I couldn't hear. Then I went downstairs to just lay down I had just worked for like 2 hours strait so I was tired. Then when I came back up stairs Camden and mom were talking about therapy. Camden said “Ethan heard you talking about it so we tolled dad and he said that he needs to syn a paper”. My mom said “well which is more important your teeth or you mind”. Camden said “you mind is more important ,but you have get dad to OK it”. Mom was not happy about that. She said “even if he doesn't Sign the paper I am taking you anyways...I not talking about this right now ”. Then Mitch came home and we said prar. Then after prayer I Had to put the kid down to bed,but camden sat and heard what he said. “I’m not going to therapy”Then Mitch said “it’s beneficial”. Just a side note how does he know that beneficial .Then my mom said “Fine go to bed”.
