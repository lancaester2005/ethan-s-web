We all were playing a game my mom said to check the rules she said it 3 or 4 times on the last time she Said It louder, meaner, etc. Then Mitch just started yelling, Then knowing my mom she started yelling too. Then I sat down on the couch and Listened .then I said to stop feeding the fire they stopped for like 5 min. Then I when down on the Stairs because to have them think I was gone.  Then my mom did two things at once she was fighting a getting on her jacket and shoes. She told Camden to ask me if wanted to go on a walk. I said yes because I didn't feel safe by myself with him. I was the last one out the door so he said: “I can leave if you what” I Ignored him” have merry Christmas” in a sassy Voice. When we left he went to his room. He came out at like 10 or 11 pm that night because my mom what sleeping on the couch. My mom got up and left to her room so Mitch could Watch some TV. They barely talked at all on Christmas Day. They even played separate games they wouldn't play the same game together. <br><br>

Today Mitch and my mom had a fight. It was about lots of things. Earlier that day Brigham hit my mom in the nose With the back of his head On accident(I was not there). It was a very bad hit, So she went to her room. I came home later and Camden told me what happened. Break and wanted to see my mom so he started banging on her door. She came out of her room and said hi. Then like 20 minutes later she asked Camden to take the dog on a walk. Brigham wanted to go on the walk with Camden but Camden didn't want him to come so he didn't go. Camden left then my mom went downstairs to ask Mitch hit if he wanted to watch Brigham. He said yes, but did not come up till later. Like 30 minutes later Camden comes home then Brigham wants to go on a walk still. Then Mitch comes up and Takes Brigham downstairs. Camden asks Brigham something. Then Camden asks Brigham do you what to go on a walk Mitch yells “NO HE DOESN'T HE WANTS TO PLAY WITH ME” or something like that. Then my mom comes back out of her room(Mitch is downstairs by now or on the stairs), and then she goes down saris to talk to Mitch. She goes down there and stars fighting. I was upstairs at the time so I did not hear what they were fighting about. But when my mom when up saris Mitch said” SO YOUR BACKING DOWN THEN” That is what Mitch said to my mom.

Mitch says "i'm the man of the house"
